README for JonoF's Shadow Warrior Port
With contributions by Ken Silverman

2 April 2005


This is a work-in-progress release of my port of Shadow Warrior using my
ported Build engine codebase. There are bugs which I'm tracking down and
fixing as an ongoing process.

WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!
1. Since this is work-in-progress I cannot and will not attest to the safety
   of using this executable. You use it at your own risk!
2. 3D Realms and Apogee do not support this port. Contact me at
   jonof@edgenetwk.com if you find problems.
WARNING! WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!

*** THINGS IN THIS VERSION.




Enjoy!
